# Wide and Deep Reccomendation System

## Overview

This wide-and-deep model combines the memorization capabilities of a linear model with the generalization capabilities of deep learning that can allow us to create a recommendation system that can predict a wider variety of choices for users. In this case, a 20 million entry movie rating and table data set from Kaggle was utlized to build a sample movie reccomendation system as a capstone project for my Data Mining course.

## Technologies Used

+`Python:`A high-level, versatile programming language that is widely used in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence due to its readability, simplicity, and large community support.

+`TensorFlow`: Framework for deep learning.

+`MLflow`: Manages machine learning workflows.

+`NumPy`: Supports numerical calculations.

+`Pandas`: Handles data manipulation and analysis.

+`Scikit-learn`: Machine learning algorithms and tools.

+`Keras`: User-friendly interface for building neural networks.

+`Jupyter`: an interactive computing environment, allowing users to create notebooks that integrate code, visualizations, and narrative text. I documented the process in various notebooks for ease of understanding and learning! :)

## Project Organization

`data_preparation.ipynb`: The purpose of this notebook is to prepare the dataset we will use to build the wide-and-deep recommendation model.

`feature_engineering.ipynb`: In this notebook, we will engineer the features we will use to build the wide-and-deep collaborative filter recommender.

`model_preparation.ipynb`: In this notebook, we train and evaluate the wide-and-deep collaborative filtering recommender using features engineered in the prior notebook.
